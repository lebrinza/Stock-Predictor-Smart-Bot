# Stock-Predictor-Smart-Bot
Many well known and accessible Stock market price prediction bots form their predictions in such a way that it is a reaction to the previous n points of data that were already collected. This system is inherently flawed since the stock market's prices are based on the reaction to current events regarding the company and aspects that surround it. 

For example, a news article is posted detailing how someone died in an autopilot tesla vehicle: Stock price decreases. Alternatively, news spreads that Tesla made a recent major advancement in their software: Stock price increases.

Whoever is first to react to such news is the one to make the better buying and selling decisions since they can buy immediately when something really good happens and sell immediately when something really bad happens. A bot that needs time to process how people react first will lead to less return and less reliability for this reason. Thus, most people already know that it is unreasonable to trust an algorithm that bases its outcome on an average of n previous data points. 

This project aims to determine how much more effective a sentiment analysis bot that reads the news is than an algorithmic bot that is far more well known.
